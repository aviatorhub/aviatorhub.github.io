<h1>ENRIZALYN S. VITOR</h1>

    <h3>(Profession / Aviation + Career Goals)</h3>


    <p>With over a decade of experience in the aviation industry, I have dedicated my career to delivering exceptional customer service and ensuring smooth ground operations for some of the world‚Äôs most prestigious airlines. Throughout my 10-year journey, I have had the privilege of serving as a Customer Service Agent and Airline Representative for leading carriers such as PAL Express, Asiana Airlines, Qatar Airways, Emirates, and STARLUX Airlines. These opportunities have allowed me to gain in-depth knowledge of ground handling operations, passenger care, and the importance of maintaining service excellence in a fast-paced, highly demanding environment.

Being part of aviation is more than just a profession for me‚Äîit is a passion that has shaped who I am and continues to inspire my career journey. The industry has given me a strong foundation in communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability, all of which I bring with me in every role I take on.

Looking ahead, I am eager to expand my expertise beyond operations and explore new opportunities in marketing and human resources, particularly within the aviation and travel sector. One of my goals is to contribute to organizations like Flying-Crews by supporting their mission, growing within their team, and continuously learning from experienced professionals in the field.

I believe that my aviation background, combined with my dedication to learning and personal growth, positions me well to bring value, creativity, and professionalism to any team I become a part of.</p>
